remove timer_event table and store next_run in meta_data column of event_config

consider a replication strategy
Time command param to include both seconds and time_str
fix number grouping on linux
investigate async/await for events and commands
off/on relay commands between org and private channels
allow adjusting timer event times with !config
add credits to !about
expose poh loot with !loot command
add a command to list all raid loot categories, cleanup !loot subcommands
combine !is and !whois?
decide whether commands should be singular or plural
add callback for settings, allow callbacks to modify/format setting value -or- have them create a custom setting and override set value, but this does not allow for a setting context
add better char_id -> char_name resolution
add bot name to database and fail on non-match
automatically give leader when using loot:change commands
